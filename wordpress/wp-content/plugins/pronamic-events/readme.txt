Pronamic Events is a basic plugin to add some Events functionality.


== Description ==

This plugin uses custom post types to add some Events functionality. Pronamic Events allows you to add, edit and remove events.

= Gravity Forms =

With [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/) and the [Gravity Forms + Custom Post Types](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gravity-forms-custom-post-types/)
you can create an form to create event posts. In most cases you also want to automatic fill in the event start date, end date 
and location. You can set this up by adding Custom Fields from the Post Fields section and give them the correct custom field
names:

*	Start Date - Field Type = Date, Name = _pronamic_start_date_date
*	Start Time - Field Type = Time, Name = _pronamic_start_date_time
*	End Date - Field Type = Date, Name = _pronamic_end_date_date
*	End Time - Field Type = Time, Name = _pronamic_end_date_time
*	Location - Field Type = Text, Name = _pronamic_location
